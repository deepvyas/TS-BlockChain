# TS-BlockChain
This repository is made with the purpose of holding all the traces in the steps of learning and implementing simple Blockchain concepts in TypeScript. The respository may have occassional markdown files in order to dump all that was going on in the mind while going through stages of implementation.

This entire thing is developed as a Express App and all the code will reside in **src** directory.
